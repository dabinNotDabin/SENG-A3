# SENG-A3
SENG-301 IS SHITTY


  So I created a skeleton for the test cases. So far I just have four Test Case Classes but we can sort them more accurately as we go. In BasicValidFunctionality.cs I wrote a test to mimic the first script. It uses a function from the Checker class in assessing unload contents. I instantiated variables that are common to all tests at the top and initialized them in the initialization function that follows. I tried to capture as many elements of the specs in this skeleton as I could including documentation for each test that defines which script it mimics, descriptive test names and grouping of related tests into seperate test cases (this grouping probably isn't final).

  The rest of the classes (ComplexValidFunctionality, BasicInvalidFunctionality, and BonusTests) have not had their instantiation or initialization implemented nor any tests properly implemented.
  
  
  I think the easiest would be to divide it into three sets of tests where we can each work on our own. We can just put the test methods wherever they seem to fit for now based on complexity and similarities and then sort that part out once we've dealt with them all.
  
  There are 21 scripts and since I did the first one, what if;
  I do      T01, T04, T07, T10, T13, U03, U06
  Shining   T02, T05, T08, T11, U01, U04, U07
  Christian T03, T06, T09, T12, U02, U05, U08
  
  Let me know what you guys think..
